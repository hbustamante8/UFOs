# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of tis project is to provide an in depth analysis of FO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The different filters created are for data, city, state, country, and shape. The data of the UFO sigthings comes from a javascript file "data.js" while the  "app.js" file contains the javascript code used to populate the tabele on the webpage. Finally, the "index.html" file sets the layout anfd format the of the webpage. In addtion, the index.html contains the format of the tabe and how the users will view and filter for desired results.

##Summary

### Drawback
One drawback of this webpage is that if someone is not familiar with the data the table contians, the typing into filter options are less useful for them. A dropdown filter options bar would be better for first time users of this webpage.

### Recoommendaations

1. Make the filter boxes drop down options with all the avaiable values visible for the user to click on. This would make the webpage more user friendly and would be more useul for first time users of this webpage.
2. The ability to filter on a date range would be very useful for the user and be a great additiioon. For example, the month of January 2010 could be filtered for. This would give all of the UFO sightings in that given month.
