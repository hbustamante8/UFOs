# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The different filters created are data, city, state, country, and shape. The data of the UFO sightings comes from a JavaScript file "data.js" while the “app.js" file contains the JavaScript code used to populate the table on the webpage. Finally, the "index.html" file sets the layout and format the of the webpage. In addition, the index.html contains the format of the table and how the users will view and filter for desired results.

## Results 
* Header and description of the UFO sightings webpage.

##Summary 

### Drawback
One drawback of this webpage is that if someone is not familiar with the data the table contains, the typing value into filter options are less useful for them. A dropdown filter options bar would be better for first time users of this webpage.

### Recommendations

1. Make the filter boxes drop down options with all the available values visible for the user to click and choose from. This would make the webpage more user friendly and would be more useful for first time users of this webpage.
2. The ability to filter on a date range would be very useful for the user and be a great addition. For example, the entire month of January 2010 could be filtered for. This would give all the UFO sightings in that given month to be seen in the table.
